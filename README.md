## Notes

While GeoGuessr is a fun project, it's worth noting a few things:

- The API calls and image grabbing system may not be the most efficient, but they get the job done without relying on paid services like Google Maps.
- Feel free to update and improve the game as you see fit! Contributions are always welcome. üëç
- Remember, this game was originally created for a school project, so please be understanding and indulgent. üòä
